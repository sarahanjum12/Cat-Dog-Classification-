# Cat-Dog-Classification-CNN
The provided code is a Python script that demonstrates a dog vs. cat image classification using a pre-trained InceptionV3 neural network architecture. 
The code begins by extracting a dataset of cat and dog images from a zip file and then displays random images from both categories.
It then constructs a neural network model by incorporating the InceptionV3 architecture, fine-tuning it for
the classification task. Data augmentation techniques are applied to enhance the model's performance. 
The script further visualizes the training process through loss and accuracy plots.
The trained model is saved, and its capabilities are
showcased by making predictions on new images, with the aid of Grad-CAM visualization.
The heatmap of the image ,image of the heatmap on region of interest and original input is displayed.
